# Copilot Instructions

This project is a CrewAI-based home app to help with everyday decisions around what to cook. The skeleton includes:
- Agents (in `agents/`)
- Tasks (in `tasks/`)
- Main logic (in `src/`)
- Simple React UI (in `ui/`)

Work through each checklist item systematically. Keep communication concise and focused. Follow development best practices.
